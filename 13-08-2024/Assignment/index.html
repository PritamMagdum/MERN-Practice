    <p>Tigers are powerful hunters with sharp teeth, strong jaws and agile bodies. They are the largest terrestrial
        mammal whose diet consists entirely of meat; the largest tiger ever recorded was an Amur tiger. The tiger's
        closest relative is the lion. In fact, without fur, it is difficult to distinguish a tiger from a lion.</p>
